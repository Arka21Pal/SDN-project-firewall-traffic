# ARP attack

This folder is specifically meant for the code and configuration of the ARP spoofing attack on Mininet.

For this task, Arka is assigned folder 01.
And Harshal is assigned folder 02.

Each will use their respective folder, come up with a draft topology (for differences in variance), and then implement the ARP spoofing attack.

Their code will be stored in their respective folders.

All commits will be done to the `dev` branch unless the code is finalised. 

As 2021-07-06, this is the first step towards a successful project on SDN, implemented on Mininet.
