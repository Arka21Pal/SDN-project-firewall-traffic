# SDN-project-firewall-traffic

This is project on SDN, specifically concerning the traffic flows inside and through SDN firewalls.

We will be implementing everything on Mininet. As Mininet is opensource, so there shouldn't be problems with regards to questions on infrastructure.

The commands for git, are placed [here](./git-help.md), for the ease of use of the members. Please come online, click on the link, and read through the commands if you have any confusion.

This repository will hold all of our code, configuration, and even thoughts and experiences (if possible) while doing the project. Of course, expecting an ideal outcome is unrealisitic. But that's OK. One has to dream for the best, to achieve something close to it.

I sincerely hope that we can make a coherent and a fun project by the end of the official period (6 months approx), and that we will learn from it. Cheers :)
